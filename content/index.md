title: Welcome to Abdulrahman's mind garden! (alpha)

Hey, this is Abdulrahman!

17 year old currently tackling senior year, occasionally dabbling into work in environmentalism, literature, and education.

This is an experimental thought garden I've set up to make select parts of my learning public. I've also been looking for an excuse to get back to writing, and I hope this it!

All of this might seem messy for now, but I'm looking to adopt a neat system of organization to keep all of this coherent. Playing around with this website is in itself experimental for me.

In the meantime, feel free to look around (I promise this isn't the final form :‑Þ).

This website's content is made using Markdown in Obsidian, and published through Quartz. Its minimalism, speed, customizability, and hosting flexibility pushed me to choose it. Special thanks to [jzhao](https://jzhao.xyz/)!
